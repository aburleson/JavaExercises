This Java program exercises the use of greater than or less than values. The user is prompted to enter a value no higher than 3.
If the value entered is 3 or below, the user gets a message saying they entered the correct answer. If they enter a number
higher than 3, the user will receive an error message and will be prompted to enter in a number no higher than 3 again.

	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int userEntry;
		final int LIMIT = 3;
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Please enter an integer no higher than " + 
				LIMIT + " : ");
		userEntry = input.nextInt();
		while(userEntry > LIMIT)
		{
			System.out.println("The number you entered was too high...");
			System.out.print("Please enter an integer no higher than " +
					LIMIT + " : ");
		}
		System.out.println("You correctly entered " + userEntry);
