This Java program does a simple exercise where the user is asked to provide a name and an age. The program saves the input
from the keyboard and displays it in a string sentence.



package Testing;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class GetUserInfo
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		String name;
		int age;
		Scanner inputDevice = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.print("Please enter your name:");
		name = inputDevice.nextLine();
		System.out.print("Please enter your age:");
		age = inputDevice.nextInt();
		System.out.println("Your name is " + name + " and you are " 
				+ age + " years old. : ) ");
	}

}
