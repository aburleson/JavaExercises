This Java program shows the difference in incrementing a number with a prefix (++number) and a postfix (number++).



package Testing;

public class IncrementDemo
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int myNumber, answer;
		myNumber = 17;
		
		System.out.println("Before incrementing (++myNumber), my number " +
				"is " + myNumber);
		answer = ++myNumber;
		System.out.println("After prefix increment, myNumber is " + 
				myNumber);
		System.out.println(" and answer is " + answer);
		myNumber = 17;
		System.out.println("Before incrementing (myNumber++), my number " +
				"is " + myNumber);
		answer = myNumber++;
		System.out.println("After postfix increment, myNumber is " + 
				myNumber);
		System.out.println(" and answer is " + answer);
	}
}
