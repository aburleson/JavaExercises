This Java program exercise creates an interaction between you and the program where it calculates how old you are 
turning in the year you enter.

import java.util.*;
import javax.swing.*;

public class AgeCalculator 
{	
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		GregorianCalendar now = new GregorianCalendar();
		int nowYear;
		int birthYear;
		int yearsOld;
		birthYear = Integer.parseInt(JOptionPane.showInputDialog
				(null, "In what year were you born?"));
		nowYear = now.get(GregorianCalendar.YEAR);
		yearsOld = nowYear - birthYear;
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "This is the year you turn "
				+ yearsOld + " years old.");
